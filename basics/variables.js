//Rule #1: You can't define a variable more than once
let petName = 'Hal'
//let petname = 'Spot' //would cause an error bc you can't declare two lets with the same variable name
petName = 'Spot'

console.log(petName)

//Rule #2: There are rules related to variable names
//let 3 = 2 //error -> variables names have to contain only letters, the dollar sign, or an underscore
let result = 3 + 4

//Rule #3: Variable names cannot be reserved keywords
//let let = 12 //error bc let is a reserved keyword
